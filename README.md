# IdlyIsekai
Just an idle game. Isekai through truck-kun. Lots of death.

### Prologue: Truck-kun
It's another long friday night. You finally get off work after doing far too much overtime for a company that cares far too little. It starts raining.
As you're crossing the street to get in your car, you see a child break away from their mother and try to run across the street. The glaringly bright
white lights of a truck pierce through the curtain of rain. The mother is stunned in the moment. You leap forward without even realizing it. One leg 
flashes out. You kick the child right in the midriff, sending them flying towards the curb. Time slows down. The truck's light become blinding. The 
child slowly panning across the air. You look at the truck just as it plows into you. There's a sickeningly loud squelch. Instant darkness. No pain.

However, the last thing you saw out of the corner of your eye was the child being splattered on the grill of a second truck-kun hidden behind the first.
Sometimes, kicking a child has consequences.
